# Foundation of Machine Learning :memo:

This `repo` is created for understanding the basic concenpts in `Machine-Learning`. The topics covered in this `repo` goes in hand with [CS725](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/cs725/) course in [Computer science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) Department of [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/).


## What is Machine Learning ?
In simple words Machine means a program which learns.
Machine Learning is a technique of training machines to perform the activities a human brain can do, albeit bit faster and better than an average human-being.
